#### Todo API
This is a RESTful API that allows you to manage your todo list. The API has endpoints for creating, updating, deleting and retrieving todos.

Requirements
To run this application, you will need:

Node.js
npm or yarn package manager
Installation
To install the dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
You will need to set up a .env file in the root directory of the project with the port environment variable:

PORT: The port that the server should run on

bash
Copy code
PORT=5000
//localhost:5000/api/v1/todo
Running the application
To start the server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the server on the port specified in the .env file.

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

GET /get-single/:id: Get a list of all todos
GET /get-all-todos: Get a single todo by ID
POST /add-todo: Create a new todo
PUT /update-todo/:id: Update a todo by ID
DELETE /delete-todo/:id: Delete a todo by ID
User Management System
To extend the API to support a user management system where each user can access their own todo, you could add the following endpoints:

POST /users: Create a new user
GET /users/:id/todos: Get a list of all todos for a specific user
GET /users/:id/todos/:todoId: Get a single todo by ID for a specific user
POST /users/:id/todos: Create a new todo for a specific user
PUT /users/:id/todos/:todoId: Update a todo by ID for a specific user
DELETE /users/:id/todos/:todoId: Delete a todo by ID for a specific user
To implement this, you would need to add a userId field to the Todo schema and use it to filter todos based on the authenticated user's ID. You would also need to implement authentication and authorization to ensure that each user can only access their own todos.
